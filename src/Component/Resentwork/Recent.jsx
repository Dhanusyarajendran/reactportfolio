Reactâ€™s simple yet powerful component structure has helped me understand how to build reusable and dynamic user interfaces. I've practiced using JSX, props, and state while building beginner-level projects such as a personal portfolio, responsive cards, and a basic blog. Each day brings new learning opportunities, from working with APIs to handling navigation using React Router. This ongoing experience is shaping my development skills and preparing me to build real-world web applications confidently.
